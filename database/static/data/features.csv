You may use this feature as many times as you would like within the same round, regardless of turn order and regardless of whether or not you have already acted."
Egg Finder,"Something about your care raises the likelihood of two matched Pokémon producing a Pokémon egg for you. Whenever you make an egg check for any two Pokémon, you may make three checks and use the best result."
Unexpected Hatch,"Your eggs begin to hatch across species!? Whenever you hatch an egg that you found after making an egg check, you may flip a coin. If you win the flip, you may choose to have the egg hatch as a Pokémon of the father’s species instead of the default mother’s species."
Natural Breeder,"You’ve learned just how to influence your baby Pokémon’s first moments of life. When you hatch an egg, you may choose which of Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, or Speed is positively or negatively influenced by nature. The nature is still randomized, but will be a nature that matches your preference when using Natural Breeder. In addition, if you don’t choose to influence the Pokémon’s nature you can pick its gender."
Parental Hyperlexia,"You begin to pick on the slightest hints, differences in tone, and micro expressions from your Pokémon as if they are speaking to you in a human language. You can understand any Pokémon that you hatched with a Loyalty of 3 or higher, when it tries to speak to you in its own Pokémon languages. If the Pokémon’s unable to speak to you in a comprehensible sense, you still understand it’s general needs and you still understand anything it might be trying to communicate to you."
Inherited Moves,"Your pairings yield powerful children often with powers beyond the baby Pokémon’s understand; with your guidance they will wield awesome attacks. Whenever you hatch your eggs, choose any one move from either parent and give it to your baby Pokémon."
Scrambled Moves,"Your influence on your Pokémon while they are eggs continues to yield unique results. Whenever you hatch an egg, choose one of the three moves the Pokémon is assigned in the Pokédex. They are given an appropriate different move by your GM."
Unlikely Pairings,"The mysterious ways that Pokémon create eggs are still unclear to you, but you’ve figured out a way to coerce eggs from Pokémon that otherwise would never make an egg. When trying to have Pokémon make Pokémon eggs in privacy, they do not need to have a matching egg group."
Familial Bond,"Your Pokémon treat you as if you were their actual parent. Any Pokémon you’ve hatched starts at Loyalty 3 with you. It takes intentional and malicious mistreatment to lower these Pokémon’s loyalties. In addition, any Pokémon you obtain are quick to warm up to you and not treat you as a hostile."
Gleaming Eggs,"Your warm influence brings out a rare quality on occasion from your baby Pokémon. Whenever you hatch one of your eggs, roll 1d20 and add your Defense or Special Defense modifier. On 20 or higher, the Pokémon that hatches is shiny."
Matchmaker,"You’ve become a master Breeder and can guarantee the Pokémon eggs that you desire. Once per day, when you make an egg check for two Pokémon, of which at least one of the two is your Pokémon, you are guaranteed to find an egg. When the egg hatches, you pick which species of the two parents the Pokémon is, which sex the Pokémon has, and which nature the Pokémon has."
Berry Mixer,"When it comes to berry treats, you’re an expert. Whenever you’re making any kind of food or item that requires berries, you are considered a certified expert and can supply your wares to specialty stores (usually at half their value), or to strangers willing to pay for your expertise."
Botanical Encyclopedia,"You’ve memorized every book there is on botany in the Pokémon world. You can instantly identify any berries, plants, or fungi and know any of their special properties. You also can tell if any of them have been modified to have unique attributes. In addition, you can identify any Grass-type Pokémon on sight, or any Pokémon known to work with, or that pretends to be, flora."
Berry Finder,"You apply your encyclopedic knowledge to the field and know where to best find berries. Whenever you make any skill checks related to berries, or finding them, you may roll twice and use the better result."
Berry Booster,"Your care for your plants is evident by the particular energy they release when consumed. Whenever a Pokémon consumes berries that you’ve grown, double any numerical effect the berry might have."
Growth Spurt,"You’ve started to apply a special fertilizer to your plants, promising quick results. Whenever you plant berries, including in a portable planter, it will never take more than 48 hours for the plant to produce fruit. In addition, if you roll under 6 while making Nature checks while caring for Berry plants, treat the roll as a 6."
Berry Combination,"You begin to practice with the qualities of berries by extracting and injecting different berries together. Once per day, after spending an hour with two of your berries, you destroy one and give its flavor and effects to the other berry to create one berry with the effects of both. Call the combination whatever you’d like. You may not combine a berry with an already combined berry."
Apricorn Finder,"You apply your knowledge of berries to lesser known and lesser studied apricorn, whenever you make any skill checks related to apricorns, or finding them, you may roll twice and use the better result."
Hybridization,"You begin to apply your studies to a berry plant itself. Whenever you plant a berry, you can plant two berries together to produce a tree that grows berries with the flavors and effects of both of the planted berries. This includes berries you may plant in a portable planter. Call the resulting combination whatever you’d like. You may not hybridize a berry with an already hybridized or combined berry."
Berry Seeker,"You find unusual signs of rarer berries and explore the space around you to find unusual and lesser seen berries. Whenever you make any skill checks related finding berries, you may attempt to find an uncommon berry. If you do, only roll once on your skill check. If you succeed, you find one of the follow berries of your choice: Pomeg Berry, Kelpsy Berry, Qualot Berry, Hondew Berry, Grepa Berry, Tamato Berry, Occa Berry, Passho Berry, Wacan Berry, Rindo Berry, Yache Berry, Chople Berry, Kebia Berry, Shuca Berry, Coba Berry, Payapa Berry, Tanga Berry, Charti Berry, Kasib Berry, Haban Berry, Colbur Berry, Babiri Berry, Chilan Berry, or Roseli Berry"
Miniature Specimen,"You apply a theory towards creating smaller, but still just as effective berry plants. You can grow two plants in a portable planter at the same time, and the berries these plants produce are small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Berries produced with the miniature specimen feature cannot be stolen from any Pokémon who is holding onto one during battle."
Rare Berry Seeker,"You may apply your vast knowledge base to explore wild space and locate treasures in the berry collecting world. Whenever you make any skill checks related finding berries, you may attempt to find a rare berry. If you do, only roll once on your skill check. If you succeed, you find one of the follow berries of your choice: Liechi Berry, Ganlon Berry, Salac Berry, Petaya Berry, Apicot Berry, Lansat Berry, Starf Berry, Enigma Berry, Micle Berry, Custap Berry, Joboca Berry, Rowap Berry, Kee Berry, or Maranga Berry"
Berry Monstrosities,"You’ve mastered the hybridizations and combination of natural berries and put it to unbelievable use and execution. When using your Berry Combination or Hybridization features, the berries you make can have a total of five different qualities from different berries. This will combine all flavors and all effects. If you combine or hybridize a sixth berries into your monstrosities, chose another berry’s flavor and effects to replace in said monstrosity. Call the combination whatever you’d like."
Energy Shot,"You’ve concocted a drink that really gives you an adrenaline rush, it could be useful out there in the wilds. Once per day, after one hour of work in on it, you create one pint of an energy drink for trainers. Call it whatever you’d like. You have enough for four servings of the drink. When one serving is consumed, it gives a trainer temporary hit points equal the sum of your Defense and Special Defense stat. The drink’s effect wears off after an hour. Drinking multiple servings will remove any temporary hit points gained by the drink. The drink’s potency wears off after 24 hours and then becomes a regular drink."
Soul Food,"You’re a great chef and have loads of experience whipping up meals. When looking for edible food in the wild, you can add your Defense or Special defense modifiers while making skill checks. It takes you less than 20 mins to create a soulful meal out of any edible ingredients for ten people and/or Pokémon. Whenever a Pokémon consumes a soulful meal within an hour of its creation, they are relaxed unless they are agitated again (it takes at least 5 mins to consume a meal). Your Pokémon quickly gain loyalty to you if you’re feeding them often and are very unlikely to lose loyalty unless there’s any intentional mistreatment."
Wild Bait,"You can create powerful aromas that attract various wilds to a place of your choosing. After 30 mins of work, you create a dish of wild bait. The bait has a powerful smell that will lure wild Pokémon to its location once you ready it. If you and your party is not sufficiently hidden, wilds may approach but flee if any wilds detect you or your party."
Sugar Rush,"You can produce treats that energize your Pokémon like nothing else. Once per day, after thirty minutes of work in on it, you create one serving of a sugary energy drink for Pokémon. Call it whatever you’d like. When it is consumed, it gives a Pokémon temporary hit points equal the sum of your Defense and Special Defense stat. The drink’s effect wears off after an hour. Drinking multiple servings will remove any temporary hit points gained by the drink. The drink’s potency wears off after 72 hours and then becomes a regular drink."
Pâtissier,"You begin practicing the art of dessert and can spend time to create delicious replicas of famous treats. Once per day, after 30 mins of work you can create two of any of the following treats. Unlike real versions of these treats, your food made with the Pâtissier feature do not have their effects after 48 hours, instead only tasting delicious.

Berry Juice, Lumiose Galette, Old Gateau, Pewter Crunchies, Shalour Sable Removes any affliction"
Herbal Medicine,"You improve several qualities of the treats you can make, but less people would call them treats now. Once per day, after 10 mins of work you can create one of the following medicines. Your Pokémon are not repulsed by your Herbal Medicine, but another trainer’s Pokémon or wild Pokémon will be disgusted.
Medicine Effect 
Heal Powder Removes any affliction 
Energy Powder Recovers 25 Hit Points (Pokémon)"
Vile Cook,"You figure out how to creates food that hide undesirable effects underneath delicious disguises. Whenever you make food, or an edible item, you may make the food Poison the consumer, Paralyze the consumer or put the consumer Sleep. The tampered food loses its potency after one hour and becomes regular edible food."
Palette Pleaser,"You’ve mastered flavor in every form. Whenever you make a meal, or mix any ingredients to make a food item with any effects, you make it in a way that is pleasing to anyone or any Pokémon who consumes it regardless of their nature, preferred flavors, or disliked flavors."
Power Recovery,Your soul food become invigorating and empowers your Pokémon to unleash powerful attacks as if they’ve rested for hours. Pokémon who have eaten your soulful food may again use their 3/day or 1/day moves as if they have rested for 8 hours. Pokémon may not benefit from the Power Recovery feature multiple times per day.
Powerful Herbs,"You’ve strengthened your foul-smelling recipes. Once per day, after one hour of work you can create one of the following medicines. Your Pokémon are not repulsed by your Powerful Herbs, but another trainer’s Pokémon or wild Pokémon will be disgusted.
Medicine Effect 
Energy Root Recovers 50 Hit Points (Pokémon) 
Revival Herb Recovers an unconscious Pokémon to half of their max HP."
Leftovers,"Through your practice, you discovered a way to create a meal that continues to heal a Pokémon after it’s consumed. Once per day, after working for one hour you create a serving of Leftovers.
Item Effect 
Leftovers When consumed, a Pokémon will recover 10 HP every 6 seconds until it’s gained a total of 100 hit points, or has recovered to max HP, then Leftovers is destroyed."
Master Chef,"You’ve proven yourself to be an unmatched chef. Nothing can dislike your food, and you know how to make any meal by tasting or looking at it once. Any effects from any food you’ve made are doubled when possible. This includes things you make with or without your features. In addition, Vile Cook can be used to Toxify food and Revival Herbs that you’ve made will recover an unconscious Pokémon to full HP."
Early Evolution,"Every Pokémon has different triggers that encourage evolution and you’ve learned to nurture these different influences and induce evolution. Your Pokémon are unhindered by any natural timing to evolve and can evolve regardless of day or night time constraints. Your Pokémon whose evolutions that require environmental influences may evolve anywhere. Pokémon who need to evolve based solely on loyalty or their relationship with you evolve much faster, even if they are barely a week old. In addition, in rare occasions, your Pokémon may evolve twice rapidly into its final evolution if given the opportunity."
Mega Stone Smith,"After studying mega stones, you’ve figured out how to imbue simple marbles with the mysterious spirit that enables Pokémon to mega evolve. Once per week, after five hours of work, you create a Keystone exclusively for your use or you create a Mega Stone exclusively for one of your fully-evolved Pokémon. When creating a Mega Stone, decide which stats are boosted while the Pokémon is using the created Mega Stone. You can modify Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, or Speed by a total of 4 points, but no individual stat can be modified by more than 2. You may not affect any stats negatively. You choose how your Pokémon’s physical appearance changes appropriately"
Elemental Evolution,"Working with some theories about the effects of elemental stones on Pokémon, you’ve figured out how to induce elemental evolution. Once per day, you may spend one hour with a Pokémon who can evolve with the use of any evolution stone and they will evolve at the end of that hour. In addition, you’ve figured out how to repress evolution in a Pokémon and after spending one hour with one of your Pokémon, you can abate evolution for 48 hours without the use of an Everstone."
Evolution Guidance,"Your training and care helps to mold your Pokémon’s futures and helps their paths of evolution. If your Pokémon has a branched evolution, when it evolves you may choose what it evolves into regardless of any other factors in its evolution. The Evolution Guidance feature overrides requirements during evolutions such as gendered evolutions (Gallade, Vespiquen), evolutions that differ based on time of day (Cascoon, Lycanroc), environment influenced evolutions (Wormadam S, Weezing A), stone evolutions (Bellossom, Vaporeon), or stat based evolutions (Hitmonchan, Gorebyss). This means you could have a male Nidorina, a night time Silcoon, a Fairy type Rapidash from a Fire type Ponyta, a Glaceon from a Moon Stone, or any other unusual evolution."
Keystone Burst,"Keystones usually need time to regain their ambient energy after use, however you’ve trained your Pokémon to only dip into the Key Stone’s power with their Mega Stones instead of draining it completely. Your Keystone may be used twice per day or three times per day if you only Mega Evolve the same Pokémon each time. You may still only have one Mega Pokémon at a time."
Mega Stone Shift,"Spending some time with your Mega Stones can give you some insight to their magical properties; with a little bit of focus you can change how your Mega Stones change your Pokémon. After two hours of work, one of your unique Mega Stones will alter your Pokémon’s types by replacing one type or by adding one type while the Pokémon is Mega Evolved. You choose how your Pokémon’s physical appearance changes appropriately."
Key Stone Stretch,"Keystones ring while your Pokémon are Mega Evolved, but you’ve learned to quell that into a hum, prolonging a Mega Evolution’s stay. Your Pokémon’s Mega Evolutions can retain their form for up to one hour, even if returned to their Poke Ball."
Peak Form,"Raising your Pokémon through their evolutions and keeping them in top shape has increased their performance. When one of your Pokémon evolves into its final stage of evolution, choose two of Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, or Speed and permanently add 1 to that Pokémon’s stats. Additionally, for any of your fully-evolved Pokémon that you’ve owned for at least one week who haven’t benefitted from Peak Form yet, choose two of Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, or Speed and permanently add 1 to that Pokémon’s stats."
Keystone Overflow,Your Pokémon have grown to use the flow of energy from the Key Stone and can even borrow its energy from each other when standing together in battle! You may have two Mega Pokémon at the same time.
Potential Break,"Mega Stones bring Pokémon to unreal levels of power, but to most you need to already be strong to use a Mega Stone with your Key Stone. However, you’ve figured out a way to induce Mega Evolution with unreal results. If you own a Mega Stone that corresponds to a Mega Evolution that appears in the Pokédex, your not-fully-evolved Pokémon that will eventually be fully compatible with a Mega Stone may already use the Mega Stone. For example, if you own Blazikenite or have created a Mega Stone to Mega Evolve Blaziken, your Torchic or Combusken could use it to turn into Mega Blaziken."
Evolution Shift,"Pokémon have their previous selves and potential selves within themselves and you’ve developed a way to manipulate and work with your Pokémon to bring out any part of themselves again. Once per day, after working for five hours with one of your Pokémon you may return it to its previous stage of evolution or change its evolution to another in its branch of evolutions. You could for example change your Marowak into a Marowak A, your Purrserker into a Persian, or your Poliwrath into a Politoed. Evolution Shift removes any benefits given to your Pokémon by Peak Form if they are unevolved during Evolution Shift until that Pokémon evolves again."
Keystone Kaleidoscope,"Evolution is different for every Pokémon and can continue to change and create new surprises for everyone. Whenever you Mega Evolve a Pokémon, you may choose which of its stats are modified by its Mega Stone and which types it becomes (you may choose different stats and types each time). You must still follow the Mega Stone rules of the features Mega Stone Smith and Mega Stone Shift while Mega Evolving your Pokémon."
Muscle Relaxants,"While they may only help without cure sometimes, your careful application of injected relaxants is a sure fix for any paralyzed ally. 3/day you may use your medical field kit as an action to cure any adjacent trainer or Pokémon of Paralysis."
Treat Minor Wound,"Your study of medicine has led to more effective use of your kit to heal the broken, damaged, and hurt. 3/day you may use your medical field kit as an action to heal any adjacent trainer or Pokémon 10 hit points, then give them 5 temporary hit points which last for 10 mins. In addition, you may not use your Medic features on unwilling, conscious targets. (A Pokémon who is healed this way cannot use a Move during the same round)"
Medicinal Expert,"Your training and practice has led you to some improved procedures that help will your friends in a pinch. Whenever you use a restorative item such as an Antidote or Potion, or a Medic feature on an allied trainer or Pokémon, heal the target additional hit points equal to your Defense or Special Defense modifier."
Better Living Through Medicine,"Careful study and repetition has given your hands the precision and skill to move rapidly and help those in need.

Treat Major Wound,"Your expertise of medicine has led to efficient use of your kit to repair the injured. 3/day you may use your medical field kit as an action to heal any adjacent trainer or Pokémon 30 hit points, then give them 15 temporary hit points which last for 10 mins. (A Pokémon who is healed this way cannot use a Move during the same round)"
Do No Harm,"Your fervor in battle and willingness to risk your life while protecting others burns brightly as you save lives around you every day. On any turn where you hAvian’t attacked any targets and have not issued any attack commands to any of your Pokémon, your Treat Minor Wound, Treat Wound, Treat Major Wound and Treat Serious Wound features heal an additional 10 hit points, but grant 10 less temporary hit points. You may not issue attack commands to any Pokémon after benefitting from the Do No Harm feature."
Treat Serious Wound,"Your mastery of medicine has led to perfect use of your kit to completely heal the injured. 3/day you may use your medical field as an action kit to heal any adjacent trainer or Pokémon 40 hit points, then give them 20 temporary hit points which last for 10 mins. (A Pokémon who is healed this way cannot use a Move during the same round)"

Observation Training,"Tutors figure out how to bring out the best from a Pokémon by studying attacks and by teaching your Pokémon everything there is to know about their own attacks, you’ve increased their odds of surviving in battle. Whenever one of your Pokémon is targeted by an attack they know, or used to know, their Defense, Special Defense, and Speed stat is raised +1 during the attacker’s accuracy check."
Passive Tutoring,"By studying some basic field tactics you’ve learned how to teach Pokémon how to improve their odds on the field of battle. Once per day, after spending two hours working with a Pokémon, you may teach one of the following passives to that Pokémon:
Howl, Nasty Plot, Defense Curl, Snarl, Run Away"

Passive Mastery,"By spending time with Pokémon you’re able to bring out the best of their natural abilities that they have concealed within. Once per day, after spending six hours working with a Pokémon, you may teach the Pokémon any nonlegendary passive. You must use some reasoning here, for example if a Pokémon cannot produce water or ice, it cannot learn Refrigerate.

In addition, you gain the following options depending on your chosen contest attributes.

Contest Tutoring,"Having seen and studied various moves that make a splash in contests you’ve figured out how to teach those moves to your Pokémon. Once per day, after spending three hours working with one of your Pokémon, you may teach a move that has a contest attribute matching one of your chosen contest attributes for your Favorite Festival feature. Moves taught with the Contest Tutoring feature must still fit the Pokémon’s learnable moves description. A Pokémon cannot benefit from Contest Tutoring more than once per week."
Command of the Stage,"There isn’t a person in the stadium who isn’t watching you perform, no matter what the event. When your Pokémon appeals to a judge, you may choose whether the judge’s voltage is changed positively, negatively, or whether it’s not affected. In addition, the first time you roll a 1 during any round of appeals, reroll that die. In addition, once per day, after spending two hours working with one of your Pokémon, you may change the contest effect of one of their moves to any contest effect permanently. In addition, during Pokémon battles, your Pokémon have +3 speed when deciding turn order if they have earned more contest ribbons than any enemy Pokémon. In addition, whenever you use a feature that temporarily grants a Pokémon a passive ability, you can use it to target an allied Pokémon instead of only being able to use it on your own Pokémon."
Base Routine,"Your Pokémon move in rhythmic ways, gracefully making their way across the stage of battle. Whenever your Pokémon do not move their full distance during their turn in combat, foes must roll +1 during accuracy check in order to hit them once per combat."
Practicing Scales,"You often sing with your Pokémon, as you try to teach them different basic melodies and sounds to make with their voices. When using attacks, your Pokémon’s move can be treated as if they are sound-based or not regardless of what they naturally are. In addition, once per day you may spend two hours with one of your Pokémon to teach them the move Soft Song."
En Point,"You and your Pokémon are not to be frazzled during battle, each step is graceful planned and executed. When you or your Pokémon do not move their full distance during their turn in combat, they cannot be Stunned or moved by a foe’s effects."
Attention to Me,"Coordinators may be able to grab attention with their charms, but you perform like none other. Whenever you make a Perform skill check with that would involve either dance or your voice roll the check three times and use the best result."
Gradual Rise,"A well-choreographed performance with a gradual rise and climax will astound the audience and judges alike. If during each round of appeals, the points you earn are each consecutively higher than your previous score, gain 10d4 points after the final appeal. In addition, if your Pokémon would deal less damage during a round of combat than their previous turn during an attack, they may deal an additional +1d6 after applying weakness and resistances once per combat."
Stage Presence,"Often, judges will be particularly interested in your Pokémon’s appeal because they always seem to add a different flourish or lovely tune while doing so. 3/day, during an appeal, you may replace up to X d4 with d6, where X is your Special Defense or Speed modifier."
Gentle Footfall,"Poise is important while dancing and in as a byproduct of your training you’ve developed particularly silent footsteps. When making Stealth skill checks, you may roll twice and use the better result. In addition, whenever your Pokémon makes an attack against a foe from behind the foe’s line of sight and was not in the target’s line of sight during that turn, they may add +2 during their accuracy checks."
Enthralling Voices,"Your Pokémon command the attention of others in battle and even influence Pokémon to stop in place, getting lost in your Pokémon’s charms. 3/day, as an action, you add the effect, “On hit, the target is Infatuated,” to one of your Pokémon’s attacks that does not already have an effect during their next turn. In addition, during the appeal rounds in contests, Pokémon making an appeal immediately after your Pokémon in the same round do not roll one of their d4 unless they have already been affected by your Enthralling Voices feature during that contest."
Dancing Dodge,"The constant flow of battle has a rhythm of its own and you with your Pokémon can slide around attacks and problems. Once per day, if you would be hit by a Pokémon’s attack that only targeted you, you may dodge it. In addition, once per week you may spend 4 hours with once of your Pokémon to teach them the move Detect."
As Rehearsed,"Often you’ll spend time with your Pokémon going over their routines for a contest, and sticking to a script often has good payoffs. At the beginning of a contest, you may choose the moves your Pokémon will be performing during each round of appeals. If you do, your Pokémon’s appeals cannot be negatively affected by other contestant’s displays and once during the contest you may have a judge you are appealing to have their voltage raised once regardless of your appeal’s contest attribute."
Elemental Flourish,"When moving about passionately, you Pokémon may release energy from themselves that enhance their performances. 3/day, as an action, you may have your Pokémon’s normal-type move change its type to match one of its types until the end of combat. In addition, once per contest you may have on of your Pokémon’s move change its attribute into a different contest attribute of your choice."
Dazzling the Stage,"Your Pokémon’s appeals are stunning and when perfectly executed your Pokémon’s performances destroy anyone else’s chance at winning. Before rolling your dice during an appeal choose a number. If your result for points during that appeal matches the chosen number, double the value of your appeal during that round."
Faster,"Kick it up! Really lean into it! Your cheers push your Pokémon to go faster and faster when it matters. 3/day, as an action, for the next 5 mins, your Pokémon within 25ft can move an additional X times 5ft per turn where X is your Special Defense or Speed modifier."
Stronger,"You’ve got this! Push harder! Your encouragement pushes some extra strength into your Pokémon’s efforts. 3/day, as an action, for the next 5 mins, your Pokémon within 25ft is twice as strong and can move objects larger than itself as if they were the same size as them and deals an additional X damage when attacking with an Attack stat move where X is your Special Defense or Speed modifier."
Work It,"This is nothing new! Get it done! Your direction helps your Pokémon overcome obstacles without issue. 3/day, as an action, for the next 5 mins, your Pokémon within 25ft treats all non-water terrain as normal terrain, can move through enemies without slowing down or being attacked, and treats vertical terrain (walls/trees /structures) as normal terrain when moving on the terrain."
Harder,"No! Not yet! Push through it! When your Pokémon hears your concern, it pushes through oncoming attacks. 1/day, when your Pokémon would be hit by an attack and the offender rolled the exact value it needed in order to hit, instead the attack misses."
Makes Us Stronger,"Everyone put everything you’ve got into it! Your enthusiasm empowers allies to push them forward. When using a Coach feature, instead of targeting just one of your Pokémon, your Coach features affect all allied Pokémon."
Surf It,"This is nothing! It’s just water! Your careful training has enabled your Pokémon’s movement both in and out of water. Your Pokémon are not hindered by movement through water, and your Pokémon who move at half speed out of water are able to move at a normal speed out of water."
Make It Better,"Great job! Rest up, we’re not done! Quick aid keeps your Pokémon in top shape for more competition. 3/day, after a battle, pokéathalon, or contest, you can spend 5 mins with your Pokémon to recover half of the hit points they lost during the combat or competition while also giving them the ability to perform 3/day and 1/day frequency moves again."
Hour After Hour,"Keep up with me! We’re not done yet! Repeated work out sessions with your Pokémon maintains them in top shape, ready for anything. If you spend at least 1 hour working out with your Pokémon during the day, after the third day within a week all of your Pokémon who participate in working out either have +1 of your choice to their Attack, Special Attack, or Speed. If you do not maintain the work out sessions, at least 3 times on different days per week, your Pokémon’s stats return to normal. Pokémon can all be working out together at the same time. No more than six Pokémon can benefit from your Hour After Hour feature at a time."
Bring It,"Come on! Imagine how hard it is for our Pokémon! Do not stop! You’ve got your whole group of friends going. If you spend at least 1 hour working out with your allied trainers during the day, after the sixth day within two weeks you and all of your friends who participate in working out either have all of the following bonuses:
You move +10 ft per turn, your Speed is +2 while determining turn order in combat, you can easily lift your weight, climbing and swimming can be done at regular speed, and you are not hindered by difficult terrain. If you do not maintain the work out sessions, at least 3 times on different days per week, your friends all lose these bonuses. Allied trainers can all be working out together at the same time. No more than six trainers can benefit from your Bring It feature at a time."
Never Over,"That’s weak! It’s nothing compared to your strength! Let’s go! Your Pokémon know what your expectations are and they’re holding on for you. As long as they hAvian’t acted, your Pokémon can give up their turns during a round to survive an attack at 1 hit point if they were at their max hit points before being attacked."
Face to Face,"Don’t let them get a lead on you! Get there! Your Pokémon can edge out a little more steam when facing a nearmatch. When determining turn order, if there is a tie, your Pokémon go first. In addition, once per day, if once of your Pokémon misses an attack by 1 or 2, you can have them successfully hit instead."
More Than Ever,"This is what it’s all been for! Don’t any of you give up! Keep on pushing until the very end! Any Pokémon or allied trainers currently benefitting from your Hour After Hour or Bring It features get to reroll their first natural 1 per day. In addition, during appeals in contests, your Pokémon currently benefitting from your Hour After Hour feature treat any rolled 1s as 2."
Accessorize,"With love and a flair of style you create an amazing accessory to beautify your Pokémon. After one hour of work, you create a Pokémon accessory. The accessory can be a piece of clothing, jewelry, or a trinket it holds. Call it whatever you’d like, made out of whatever you like. In addition, it takes you one hour to repair any broken item or accessory made by you.
Accessory - Once per day, during the introduction appeal of a contest, add 1d4. If the result of that d4 is a 3 or 4, the Accessory cannot be used this way again unless repaired with the Accessorize feature. A Pokémon can only benefit from one accessory at a time."
Practical Designer,"Creating a perfect something that just makes someone’s look pop can help a person succeed when they least expect it. After one hour of work, you create a trainer accessory. The accessory can be a piece of clothing, jewelry, or a trinket someone holds. Call it whatever you’d like, made out of whatever you like. In addition, you are skilled in making clothing for trainers and can produce a shirt, pants, or dress in about 3 hours out of appropriate materials.
Trainer Accessory - Whenever you roll a Skill Check while talking to someone else, you may add +2 to your roll. If your skill check succeeds, the Trainer Accessory cannot be used this way again unless repaired with the Accessorize feature. A person can only benefit from one trainer accessory at a time."
Lucky Charm,"Something about the perfect charm on your wrist, or in your hair, or wherever you think someone should place it, just clicks and makes someone’s personality really come out. After two hours of work, you create a Lucky Charm. The charm can be a piece of jewelry, or a trinket you wear. Call it whatever you’d like, made out of whatever you like.
Lucky Charm - Whenever you roll a Skill Check and fail, you may reroll and use the second result. If you fail again, you fumble in some way and lose 1d10 hit points. The Lucky Charm cannot be used this way again unless repaired with the Accessorize feature. A person can only benefit from one lucky charm at a time."
Bright Charm,"You focus your efforts on an accessory with some kind of gimmick; mundane at first, but with the flick of a wrist a pop of confetti or a flash of smoke appears. After one hour of work, you create a Bright Pokémon Accessory. The accessory can be a piece of clothing, jewelry, or a trinket it holds. Call it whatever you’d like, made out of whatever you’ like. 
Bright Charm - When you appeal to a judge you may use the Bright Charm to raise the judge’s voltage +1. The Bright Charm cannot be used this way again unless repaired with the Accessorize feature. A Pokémon can only benefit from one accessory at a time."
Tactical Design,"It’s not always about looks, but when you do need a glove for climbing or a show for running, you can make it and make it look good. After six hours of work you create a clothing equipment for a trainer that has a specific application (running shoes, grip gloves, camouflage cape, etc.). Call it whatever you’d like, made out of whatever you like.
Clothing Equipment - Whenever you roll a Skill Check while doing the activity the equipment is made for, you may add +1 to your roll. The equipment loses this ability after two weeks but can be repaired with the Accessorize feature. A person can only benefit from one clothing equipment at a time."
The Look,"Sometimes, you just have to take another person’s design and make it your own. By looking at what someone else is currently wearing you’re able to make the same clothing out of the same material, adjusted for whomever you’re planning to have wear the clothing. It would take 2 hours of work per piece of clothing/accessory to replicate the what the person was wearing when you saw them. You may apply effects of your Designer features to any individual piece of clothing or accessory throughout the set of things that you are copying. Unskilled individuals cannot determine whether or not your products are an original or a fake."
Glamourous,"Bold fashion statements can catch the eyes of everyone and it makes it hard not to catch everyone’s gaze when you’re the designer. When making clothing for trainers, you may spend an extra hour making the clothing to give the clothing the following effect:
“All non-allied trainer’s Perception and Investigate Skill checks are -1 when you are within their line of sight.”"
Cosplay Designer,"It’s not always practical, but you’re an amazing costume designer. You can spend 30 hours over multiple days to create a medium or smaller Pokémon costume that passes for a real Pokémon unless investigated at a distance of less than 10ft. You may make it out of whatever you’d like, but the cheaper your materials, the more likely it is for someone else to recognize the costume as a costume. If you spend over 100 hours on making your costume, it is very difficult to tell that a person inside the costume is not whatever the costume is disguising them as- at any distance."
Flawless Accessory,"With more love and a greater flair of style you create a perfect accessory to beautify your Pokémon. After two hours of work, you create a perfect Pokémon accessory. The accessory can be a piece of clothing, jewelry, or a trinket it holds. Call it whatever you’d like, made out of whatever you’ like."
Item Builder,"You’ve spent hours working to figure out how the battle accessories manufactured by professional companies work and you’ve figured a few of them out. Once per week, you may spend eight hours working to build one of the following items:
Destiny Knot, Elemental Plate, Expert Belt, Focus Band, Focus Sash, King's Rock, Muscle Band, Quick Claw, Razor Claw, Terrain Seeds, Weather Rocks, Terrain Extender, Shell Bell, Wise Glasses"
Item Manufacturer,"After working to build so of your own, you’ve figured out the rest and can create your own arsenal of items of your Pokémon’s use. Once per week, you may spend eight hours working to build one of the following items:
Air Baloon, Absorb Bulb, Adrenaline Orb, Assault Vest, Big Root, Binding Band, Black Sludge, Cell Battery, Choice Band, Choice Scarf, Choice Specs, Eviolite, Heavy Duty Boots, Life Orb, Protective Pads, Rocky Helmet, Safety Goggles
The items made with Item Manufacturer need one hour of your maintenance per two weeks, otherwise they break. Call it whatever you’d like, made out of whatever you like."
Endless Versatility,"Accessories, items, clothing- it doesn’t matter; you’ve got a creative itch and you’re ready to make it all. When making something with your Designer features, you only take 3/4ths of the time to produce the whatever it is you’re making. In addition, you can alter the effects of the items you make with the Item Builder and Item Manufacturer features by changing any Pokémon type word, or stat word (for example you could make a Black Sludge item work with Fairy types instead, or make an Absorb Bulb activate on a Fire-type attack, then raise Speed). In addition, you can use your Cosplay Designer feature to create costumes of other people you have seen before (pictures work if you have views of their front, sides, and back). In addition, you may make held items with your features that affect trainers instead of Pokémon that are all one-time use items."
Expert Grooming,"It’s a groomer’s duty to keep their Pokémon’s fur fluffy, feathers dusted, or scales shined. You can spend fifteen mins with one of your Pokémon to give them an Expert Grooming. After the grooming they are relaxed unless they are agitated again, you can emphasize and polish their physical appearance, making them appear to be healthy, sick, or any other physical state within normal variation for their species. Your Pokémon quickly gain loyalty to you if you’re grooming them often and are very unlikely to lose loyalty unless there’s any intentional mistreatment."
Pokémon Whisperer,"Humans are rarely inclined to start a fight while already in conversation, and neither are Pokémon. After speaking in a calm tone to a Pokémon for at least ten seconds, that Pokémon will refrain from attacking as long as you continue speaking, you and your allies do not approach them or initiate combat, and there is no clear threat to them. If you are already physically but nonviolently handling them as you begin speaking with them, they will allow you to continue to handle them or use your Groomer features on them."
Touch Up,"With some quick snips, brushing, and balms you fix up your Pokémon. 3/day, after spending a minute grooming a Pokémon, choose two of the following benefits for that Pokémon. You must choose different options. 
• Restore the single use of a Pokémon’s 3/day move. 
• Heal 4 HP. 
• +2 to Attack, Special Attack, or Speed for ten minutes, or until they take damage, whichever comes first. 
• The first two rolled 1s during contest appeals can be rerolled during the next contest on the same day."
Groomer's Eye,"By working with Pokémon to make them look the best they can all the time, you have insight into a Pokémon's needs when you’re working with them. When making Pokémon Handling checks you can roll twice and use the better result. If you’re grooming or pacifying a Pokémon as you do this, roll three times and use the best result instead. In addition, while grooming a Pokémon, you can determine any stressors that the Pokémon is dealing with (maltreatment, hunger, sickness, etc.), whether or not it is loyal to its trainer, any special traits of its parentage or birth environment, any special needs it may have."
Contest Coating,"They’re just too much to look at! They’re so amazingly over the top! Your special care really gives your Pokémon an edge during Contests. Your Pokémon can have up to 12 points total contest stats. In addition, loyal Pokémon you’ve had for at least one week that have been cared for with Expert Grooming do not take a penalty to their stat because of their nature."
Quick Cleanse,"Some Pokémon need special attention to take care of a particularly bad day battling and with careful grooming, you’ve got them covered. 3/day, as an action, you can cure a Pokémon of any afflictions, remove any lingering negative stat effects, or prevent the next affliction the Pokémon would receive that day."
Attribution Assistance,"All this grooming is supposed to be for showing off a contest, so you’ve begun to focus on what makes a Pokémon pop in a stricter contest setting. Once per day, while Expert Grooming, you may add 1 point to any of the Pokémon’s contest stats, but cannot raise any of their contest stats to a value higher than whichever is the higher value between your Special Defense and Speed stats."
Glossy Alteration,"These makeover looks are stunning and have a functional form. 1/day, while Expert Grooming a loyal Pokémon, you may have the groomed Pokémon gain one of the following Passives or Skills: Immunity, Limber, Magma Armor, Vital Spirit, or Water Veil; or Alluring, Glow, Repulsive, or Stealth. Each of your Pokémon cannot have more than one passive and/or skill granted by Glossy Alteration at a time. 
Passives: 
Immunity - You are immune to getting Poisoned and Toxified. 
Limber - You are immune to being Paralyzed. 
Magma Armor - You are immune to being Frozen. 
Vital Spirit - You are immune to being put to Sleep. 
Water Veil - You are immune to being Burned"
Groundbreaking Makeover,"It’s unorthodox, it’s wild, it’s insane but you’ve figured it out and you’ve got the perfect customers- your lovely Pokémon! Once per week, after spending 10 hours working on one of your loyal Pokémon, they become a shiny Pokémon. Choose any color for them to permanently become in whatever pattern you’d like. In addition, during introductory appeals in contests, your shiny Pokémon adds 2d4 to their initial appeal and can replace any of their move’s contest effects with 
the Attention Grabber, Interrupting Appeal, or Special Attention effect once per contest."
Head Turner,"It’s not your expertise, but why not dive into the world of trainer haircuts and styling? You can spend fifteen mins with another trainer to give them a makeover. If you change the trainer’s hair style, hair color, or general amount of make up they might use, it’s possible that they won’t be immediately recognizable. When made over, trainers making Bluff or Diplomacy skill checks within the first 12 hours of your makeover get +1 on their skill check on their first skill check per person they interact with. You may make yourself over, but it takes thirty mins to use Head Turner instead."
Secured Style,"The contest stage is a battlefield, just as much as the battlefield is a performance stage, and with your beautification, your Pokémon are ready for anything! 1/day, after Expert Grooming a loyal Pokémon raise its Defense or Special Defense by 2 for 3 hours. Additionally, the Pokémon can ignore the contest effect of one move performed by an opponent during a con- test that would affect when your Pokémon performs during appeals, or prevents voltage manipulation of some kind."
Elite Glamour,"Untouchable beauty for any Pokémon in ten to fifteen minutes. 1/day, after Expert Grooming a loyal Pokémon, they may give them an Elite Coat. The Coat has the following ability: The first time you take damage from an attack, halve the damage. This coat lasts for 12 hours and does not disappear when a Pokémon with the Elite Coat is returned to a Poké Ball."
Incognito,"You chose the path of fame and maintain an online presence that garners thousands if not hundreds of thousands of followers, so it’s a good skill to be able to lay low. When you want to, you can change your clothes or style in some way to become uninteresting. While uninteresting, it’s much harder for others to notice what you’re doing and your Stealth and Sleight of Hand Skills are +2, however your Bluff, Insight, and Diplomacy Skills are all -2."
Influencer,"There’s very little stopping you from getting what you want, just by standing by something or somewhere, others will want to be there buying those things, too. When purchasing items for yourself or your Pokémon, you will get a discount depending on the size of the store or other place of service. A small mom and pop shop will not give you that much of a discount but larger conglomerate stores will give you more generous discounts and even gifts. While all stores are obligated to give you discounts, be aware that any pushy behavior may result in unwelcome behavior from the store’s employees."
Golden Cheer,"Your exuberance raises the mood of your allies and helps them to succeed whenever you’re cheering them on. Once per day, when an ally makes an attack, or attempts a skill check, they may roll twice and use the better result. If the attack or skill check already is making two or more rolls, add another roll and use the best result."
Autographs and Selfies,"When you want to flaunt it and catch everyone’s attention, you’re usually able to cause quite a scene by announcing your presence. As long as you are in a region where your fame is known (at least 3 ribbons and/or badges) you can announce your presence and cause a distraction. Nonallied trainers nearby are compelled to either join you, asking for your autograph or a photo with you, or are just distracted by the spectacle of your showmanship. If anyone becomes distracted by something other than you, or are otherwise alerted, they will stop whatever it is they were doing with you earlier than normal, if not immediately."
Garnered Loyalty,"Your Pokémon love you and if they don’t, they are really easy to win over. Your Pokémon with under 4 loyalty, rapidly gain loyalty. It takes no more than 24 hours to raise one of your Pokémon’s loyalty one stage unless they are already at 4 loyalty. It takes intentional and malicious mistreatment to lower your Pokémon’s loyalties."
Seat of Celebrity,"Once well known in your expertise, you dominate the personalities in your sphere of influence and others will often go out of their way to make a mutually beneficial deal go through. Depending on the base classes you have, you gain some of the following options (it is possible to lose access to the coordinator option if you pick another base class in the future)
Ace Trainer You may call upon regionally famous gym leaders, elites, brains or any other famous and powerful trainers to aid you in your efforts in a competition or just for an exhibition match even if you’ve never met them before and it’s likely that they will join you.
Breeder You have access to a regional list of breeders for rare or expensive Pokémon species and can arrange appointments free of charge for your Pokémon to produce eggs with any regionally available Pokémon.
Coordinator (only) As an exclusive coordinator, you have woven your ties in deep throughout your regional community. When joining a contest, you are made aware of any serious competition and are told who the judges will be. In addition, 3/day when your Pokémon makes an appeal, they may raise a judge’s voltage. In addition, during their introductory appeal, other contestants get -X points where X is your Special Defense or Speed modifier.
Ranger You have access to the captains of the regional ranger union and can call upon their personal help in any dangerous situations or use your influence to rally many civilians to aid in ranger efforts with little trouble.
Researcher You have access to any regional professors and doctors who will meet with you, plan joint research endeavors, and even research things for you within reason free of charge."
Stirring Speech,"When you lead a positively powerful speech, you encourage everyone to get up and finish what they started. Once per day, you may spend 3 mins encouraging your allies. All allies, trainer and Pokémon alike, are healed of any afflictions, then at the start of their next combat encounter, they gain 5 temporary hit points."
On the List,"By virtue of being who you are, most people will believe you are supposed to be where you say you’re supposed to be, doing what you say you’re supposed to be doing. When making a Bluff skill check, you may roll three times and use the best result. Only a person in charge off an entire organization might disagree with your behavior and expose you."
Platinum Cheer,"You raise a wild energy around you when cheering on your friends’ efforts, making them believe anything is possible! Once per day, as an action, you give an energetic cheer that empowers all allies. For 10 mins, all allies deal +X damage when attacking, all allied skill checks add +2 to their roll, all skill checks made against your allies are -2 during their roll, and all allies recover X hit points, then gain X temporary hit points. X is equal to your Special Defense or Speed modifier."
Disheartening Blow,It’s very unkind and probably beneath you but your presence can be demoralizing when you pair it with a nasty insult. 3/day you may use the move Vicious Insult.
Empowering Aid,"Your friends are amazing and your friendships are supportive and powerful. When making a skill check, your allies can help you to succeed by using an action to add X to your skill check, where X is their highest modifier. When an ally is making a skill check, you may use an action to add Y to their skill check, where Y is your Special Defense or Speed modifier."
Preposterous Wealth,"You’re on top of the world and have many fanatic followers from all over the planet. Your wealth is a non-issue and if something is sold somewhere, you can afford it. The limitations of what you’re allowed to obtain/purchase is any kind of Pokémon that are in some way unusual due to being shiny, a strange typing, or having some other oddity about them. You also cannot buy something that is not for sale, for example if a Master Ball is not being sold because it’s a prototype, a collection piece, or out of stock you wouldn’t be able to buy it. Even then, if someone is selling a shiny Pokémon, you pay them and can have it or could commission a talented smith to create a Master Ball over time. In addition, any Rising Star feature that is limited by regional fame is now expanded to a global range."
Authority Figure,"Rangers are protectors of the Pokémon world, acting as an intermediary for humans and Pokémon alike and coming to the aid of anyone in need results in a certain attitude from the general public. When making Diplomacy checks, roll twice and use the better result. You work with and are generally respected by other Rangers. When requesting assistance from a local Ranger station on an important issue, the station is obligated to lend help in some form except for in extraordinary circumstances."
Befriend,"A Ranger’s styler isn’t just a symbol of authority, it’s a valuable tool used to work with wild Pokémon and help your causes. 3/day, as an action, a non-agitated wild Pokémon within 25ft becomes Helpful. This Helpful Pokémon will remain under your guidance until the Helpful Pokémon is hit by an attack, severely distracted, or has helped you in a significant manner once, such as by making an attack. You do not get a list of any Skills or moves you cannot deduce yourself, and it cannot be taken from the area you found it in or it will run away. You may only have one Helpful Pokémon at a time. In addition, when using Pokémon Handling, you may add your Defense or Speed modifier to your skill check instead of your Special Defense modifier."
Companion,"After finding a valuable ally, the Ranger may promote a wild and make them a fellow defender of the Pokémon world. Once per day, make a Helpful Pokémon your Companion. You may only have one Companion at a time. If you give a new Pokémon the Companion title, you free your previous Companion and replace it with your new one. This process makes your Companion Pokémon have at least Loyalty 2. Your Companion Pokémon will be obedient towards the Ranger, regardless of circumstances before being restrained. The Companion Pokémon cannot participate in official battles or contests. The Pokémon cannot be returned to a Poke Ball. Companions are considered Helpful, but act in combat as if they were owned. Companion Pokémon who are replaced by a new Companion Pokémon are still wild and will likely return to the wild. You may have a Companion Pokémon and a Helpful Pokémon at the same time. In addition, you may now use your Befriend feature 5/day."
Dizzy,"Using a stylist with some extra effort lets you disorient Pokémon. 3/day, you may use the attack Stylish Spin."

Ward,"Wild Pokémon going on rampages aren’t unheard of and it’s a Ranger’s duty to stop them before anyone gets hurt, including the rampaging Pokémon. 3/day, as an action, an aggressive or rampaging wild Pokémon within 25ft becomes Helpful. This Helpful Pokémon will remain under your guidance until the Helpful Pokémon is hit by an attack, severely distracted, or has helped the Ranger in a significant manner once, such as by making an attack. You do not get a list of any Skills or moves you cannot deduce yourself, and it cannot be taken from the area you found it in or it will run away. You may only have one Helpful Pokémon at a time. In addition, you may now use your Befriend feature 7/day."

Aid of the Wild,"When working to save the Pokémon world, friendly Pokémon can follow your lead with little direction. Once per day, for a number of rounds equal to your Defense or Speed modifiers, a chosen Helpful Pokémon acts on its own in combat, attacking foes or helping to complete a task without requiring orders. The GM controls the Helpful Pokémon under the effect of this feature. The target does not flee or retreat if injured while under the effects of this feature like another Helpful Pokémon."
Styler Slinger,"Throwing your styler around skillfully has become second nature. As an action, you can use Befriend twice during your turn. You can also use Ward and Befriend as a single action during your turn. If you use Befriend or Ward with your Styler Slinger feature, you still deplete their uses per day. In addition, you may now use your Befriend feature 9/day."
Natural Leader,"Working with wild Pokémon and studying them has led to a natural well of knowledge- you just know how to work with Pokémon that you lasso with you stylist. You know of any special skills, moves, or unusual typing a wild you’ve made into a Helpful Pokémon. In addition, Helpful Pokémon are only dismissed once you dismiss them (usually Helpful Pokémon are dismissed after being hit by an attack, severely distracted, or after helping you in a significant manner once). You may not force Helpful Pokémon to leave their homes, only your Companion can leave wild areas with you."
Wild Commander,"Serving the world of Pokémon comes with special responsibilities, but successfully protecting both people and Pokémon alike until renowned carries a sort of aura that makes wild Pokémon join your cause. You may use Befriend as many times as you’d like per day, and you may use Ward up to 7/day. In addition, using your Befriend feature, you may have up to three Helpful Pokémon at the same time in addition to a Companion Pokémon."
Commander’s Rally,"After serving the world of Pokémon for a long enough time, your presence alone inspires greatness.

In addition, when using an Insight check against these individuals, you may add your Defense or Speed modifier to your skill check instead of your Special Defense modifier."

Partner’s Aid,"Your companion has taken a liking to police work and will help any way it can to succeed in bringing down criminals. If your Conspiracy Catcher feature is applicable to a Skill check and your Companion Pokémon is within 5ft of you, add 3 to your Skill Check."
Disguise,"Sometimes, it’s better if you don’t look like a Ranger. After ten minutes of work, you are unrecognizable unless you reveal who you are to someone else or if they observed you disguising yourself. Your Pokémon, Helpful Pokémon, and Companion Pokémon can recognize you. You may not impersonate anyone with Disguise."
Stop Right There,"When you’ve got a criminal in your sights, you’ll do everything in your power to apprehend them. While chasing a foe, you may move an additional 30ft per round of combat and your Speed modifier is +2 while using any Skills."

Restraining Order,"Maneuvering wilds with your styler can help you stop any criminal who might try to get away. You may issue a command to any of your Pokémon, your Helpful Pokémon, or your Companion Pokémon to use the move Block. Helpful Pokémon are not compelled to leave your service until Block’s effect ends."
Master of Disguise,"You’ve studied the trade of infiltration and would say that you’ve mastered impersonation. After one hour of work, you may disguise yourself as a specific person, Pokémon, or even an inanimate object of your size and be unrecognizable as a fake to the eyes of everyone around you. Your voice pass if you succeed a Bluff skill check, but you may roll twice during Bluff skill checks while disguised as someone and use the better result."
What’s That Over There,"Misdirection often lets you get by pesky guards, nosy bystanders, or shady civilians and investigate in unorthodox ways. 3/day, you may distract a target human or Pokémon with a trick or a menial chore for X minutes, where X is equal to your Defense or Speed modifier. The target is compelled to complete whatever task you convince them to do. If they become distracted by something other than you or your chore, or are otherwise alerted, they will stop whatever it is they were doing earlier than normal, if not immediately."
Ultimate Interrogator,"Through whatever means you’ve developed, you’re able to break open any locked lips and find out what you need in order to nab your criminal quarry. After spending twenty minutes with your Companion and a bound criminal foe, they will answer questions you have of them truthfully and as detailed as possible. Ultimate Interrogation must be used in a relatively private space, such as a questioning room in a Ranger Station or a room in a private residence."
Battle Capable Riding,"Using a mount in combat means you’re a part of combat, but your Pokémon’s got you covered. Whenever you are hit by an attack while mounted, your mount may automatically intercept the hit and take the damage for you. If you would have both been hit, only your mount takes damage."
Stick to It,"You’re a natural Pokémon rider and know all the tricks to stay on your mount when riding. When mounted on one of your Pokémon or your Companion Pokémon, you automatically succeed on all checks to remain on your mount caused by attacks and status conditions. You can ride your mounts on their side, while hanging upside down from them, while standing on them or any other odd way of staying on your mount as if you are riding the mount as normal."
All-Terrain Pokémon,"With careful guidance, you’ve trained your Pokémon to navigate anything from rocky crag or oilslicked streets.

Your All-Terrain Pokémon feature doesn’t work if your mount can’t swim and is in or under water."

Mounted Quick Switch,"Training and practice has led to an amazing maneuver allowing you make a small jump in order to change your mounted Pokémon without a moment between. You can switch out Pokémon you are mounted on to another Pokémon in your Poke Balls without dismounting by placing the new Pokémon in the exact place as a Pokémon you are returning, even if your mount is in motion. You may even switch the type of mount while it is moving (sky to land, sea to sky, etc.)."
Qualified Ride,"It doesn’t matter what you’re riding into battle, your expertise transfers with you, not your ride. Allied trainer’s Pokémon and Helpful Pokémon are treated as your own Pokémon and Companion Pokémon for the purposes of using Rider features."
Ride Pager,"With little effort you can find wilds willing to help you get to where you need to be. While in wild territory you can spend twenty minutes to find a Pokémon who can serve as a mount for yourself or an allied trainer. Once Helpful, the Pokémon will allow itself to be ridden for up to 8 hours or until it has been hit by an attack or given another command that would dismiss it."
Watch and Learn,"By using your styler to steer another Pokémon, you can handle Pokémon you aren’t even riding as well as you handle your own. As long as they are within 10ft of you, allied trainers can benefit from your Battle Capable Riding, AllTerrain Pokémon, Full Speed, and Mounted Quick Switch features."
Charge,"While maneuvering your Pokémon, nothing can stop your advance. 3/day, if you maneuver a Pokémon you are mounted on through a space occupied by any enemy Pokémon, you may make a Charge on Through attack against them. You may still make another attack with your mounted Pokémon at the end of their movement."
Form Up,"On your signal, your ally’s mounted Pokémon group up with you for better maneuvering and mounted combat at your lead. 3/day, you may use Form Up as your action in order to move all allied mounted Pokémon up to 25ft closer to you.

Element of Surprise,"By planning stings and operations in order to maximize chances of success without any harm coming to your allies, you’ve figured out the best means of attack in any given situation. During a surprise round of combat, where only you and your allies are attacking, all allies deal +5 damage during attacks before applying weakness and resistance."

Internalized Senses,"Leaving civilization for days at a time is a lot safer now that you have a natural tendency to explore the wild. At any time, you can discern the direction you are facing.

In addition, when using Nature, you may add your Defense or Speed modifier to your skill check instead of your Special Attack modifier."

Watch the Sky,"Weather can be bad for different reasons, but careful planning helps you and your Pokémon get through the worst nature can throw at you. Your Pokémon, Helpful Pokémon, and Companion Pokémon are treated as if they have the Overcoat passive ability. In addition, you can tell if wild Pokémon nearby have any way to change the weather through the use of moves, passives, or other abilities."
Pacifier,"Using your styler to help the wilds comes naturally and easily when you’re not working to fight against another Pokémon.

In addition, when making accuracy checks with ranged weaponry roll twice and use the better result."

The shelters are impossible to recognize as shelters unless standing next to them and wild Pokémon will ignore shelters built by you.
At Ease in the Wild,"You favor the wilds to human civilization and feel better rested when at your true home. Whenever you rest in the wilds for at least 6 hours, you wake up at your max HP, cured of any afflictions. If you are suffering from diseases, have any broken bones or open wounds, these are not automatically healed. You feel well rested after only 6 hours of sleep in the wild."
Natural Guide,"Rangers don’t always travel on their own and others don’t inherently work as well in the wild as their guide, except when they’re with you. While in the wild, difficult terrain does not slow you or any of your allies, you and your allies cannot become lost unless they are more than a mile away from you, and you and your allies do not suffer any penalties on Perception skill checks even while engaged in other activities."

One with Nature,"You could do anything in the wilds and never need to revisit a city or town ever again. When making skills checks out of combat in the wild, roll three times and use the best result. When rolling accuracy checks in the wild, you and your Companion Pokémon roll twice and use the better result. When targeted by an attack while in the wilds, foes must roll +2 during accuracy checks to hit you. You and your Companion Pokémon do not initiate attacks of opportunity from foes while in the wild. You are immune to afflictions while in the wild."
Field Commander,"Your expertise helps to see lines of strategy that might not necessarily need the help from one of your Pokémon in any given moment and by working with your allied trainers, you can help to turn tides and dominate the ever-flowing field of combat. You may issue commands to allied Pokémon who has not already acted during this round of combat. There must be understood consent from the Pokémon’s trainer unless they are unconscious. Pokémon may still only act once per round of an encounter. You still may only issue one command per round."

Game Plan,"By sharing various plans with teammates to employ while researching in the field, you’re ready to initiate strategies with various signals. 3/day as an action, move yourself, all allied trainers, and allied Pokémon within 30 ft of you, X multiplied by 5 ft, where X is your Special Attack or Special Defense modifier. There must be understood consent from any allied Pokémon’s trainer unless they are unconscious. Unconscious or afflicted allied trainers and Pokémon cannot be moved by Game Plan."

By practice more signals, your friends can work with you to win in more situations. 3/day, as an action, you may issue a command to an allied Pokémon who has acted during this round of combat. The command you issue must be to use an At-Will frequency move they know. The Pokémon may not use that At-Will move during their next turn. There must be understood consent from the Pokémon’s trainer unless they are unconscious."
Walking Doctorate,"Knowledge of the world comes easy and nothing stops your constant intellectual growth. By looking at a Pokémon, you can tell if it has any unusual characteristics that would not be found in a Pokédex book (such as different typing, significantly altered stats, etc.). You also can instantly identify any item, regardless of origin, and know its intended use though you might not be able to efficiently use it as intended. You can also identify any special talents of a trainer just my looking at them (what advanced classes they might have)."
Poké Linguist,"It doesn’t come easy, but with careful study and practice you learn to mimic and vocalize various Pokémon languages.

You can only study one Pokémon language at a time."
Strategic Sabotage,"Your careful placement and deliberate means of intimidate can set up perfect moments for your entire party. Once per day, as an action, move yourself, all trainers, and Pokémon within 45 ft of you, X multiplied by 5 ft, where X is your Special Attack or Special Defense modifier. Unconscious or afflicted allied trainers and Pokémon cannot be moved by Strategic Sabotage. Strategic Sabotage may be used as the first action of a round of combat regardless of your Speed."
Grand Strategist,"Obsessive studying and long nights figuring out the optimal means of tactical deployment has molded you into a master strategist. Whenever yourself, an allied trainer, or allied Pokémon within 30ft of you uses an action or attacks, they may move 10ft afterwards. Whenever you issue a command to a Pokémon, the Pokémon gets +2 during its accuracy check. Whenever you use an item on an adjacent ally, using the item is a free action once per turn. Finally, whenever you return a Pokémon to its Poke Ball and send out another Pokémon, it may act last during that round of combat instead of waiting for the next round of combat if you hAvian’t issued a command yet during that round of combat."
Adventuring Historian,"You’ve studied geological history obsessively and know everything there is to know about ancient history and exploring underground. Whenever making a History skill check or any skill check related to digging downwards, exploring underground, or exploring ruins, roll twice and use the better result."
Quick Dig,"Digging and investigating downwards is the best way to find out more about the world’s past and you’re a master excavator. Using any shovel, over the course of ten minutes, you dig a 5ft3 hole in the ground. If anything is revealed in the space you dig up, you uncover it without damaging it. You need breaks to excavate this quickly and without damaging potential specimens. You can spend 3mins concealing any dug holes and looks like regular ground unless spotted with the Investigate or Perception skills. You can’t use Quick Dig for more than twenty minutes at a time without a 10min break and can’t use Quick Dig for more than 3 hours per day."

After spending at most one hour using Quick Dig per day, you find an evolutionary stone, weather rock, elemental gem, valuable stone, or on very rare occasions, mega stone or z-crystal. Roll 1d100, subtracting your Special Attack or Special Defense modifier from the result and your GM will reveal what you’ve found."
Superb Spelunker,"You have an intuitive and almost magical sense of direction underground. You cannot get lost underground or in any ruins. When discerning direction of where you’d like to go within an unexplored area, you know what direction to go if you know what specific rooms or items you’re looking for. You also will always find any traps, natural or otherwise, while exploring underground or ruins."
Fossil Finder,"Finding terranean tells of preserved specimens below ground has become natural to you, a studied geologist. Using your ingenuity, you know where to find fossils! After spending at most one hour using Quick Dig per day, you find a piece of a preserved Pokémon fossil which you can immediately identify. Roll 1d100, subtracting your Special Attack or Special Defense modifier from the result and your GM will reveal the species of the fossil you’ve found. The fossil will likely reflect the space you’ve excavated in; a water Pokémon near the ocean, a grass Pokémon in a forest, a rock or fire type near a volcano. If you’re lucky you’ll find an ancient fossils or fossils that might not reflect the Pokémon found locally in modern times."
Fossil Resurrection,"You’ve studied for a long time and finally constructed your very own portable fossil reanimator. Once per day you may use your fossil reanimator for three hours to create an egg from any fossil that will hatch a Pokémon of the matching species. Your reanimator machine needs weekly maintenance and will break into disrepair without you. If you lose or break your reanimator, it takes four hours for you to repair it. You may not use the same fossil sample more than once to create an egg. You may only use your portable fossil reanimator once per day, regardless of the feature you are using."

The hole is concealed and looks like regular ground unless spotted with the Investigate or Perception skills."
Stone Energizer,"Using your reanimator to infused its energies into stones yield fascinating results. Once per day, you may use your fossil reanimator for one hour to give it back its ability to evolve a Pokémon. You may even change it into any other evolutionary stone (Dawn Stone, Dusk Stone, Fire Stone, Ice Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone, Shiny Stone, Sun Stone, Thunder Stone, or Water Stone). You may only use your portable fossil reanimator once per day, regardless of the feature you are using."

Use your Special Attack or Special Defense modifier while rolling Rock Slide’s accuracy check. The hole is concealed and looks like regular ground unless spotted with the Investigate or Perception skills."
Stone Master,"Using your intuition and by simply feeling the earth, you know where to find rare, lost, treasures. After spending at most one hour using Quick Dig per day, you locate a valuable stone, a mega stone, or z-crystal. Roll 1d100, subtracting your Special Attack or Special Defense modifier from the result and your GM will reveal what you’ve found."
Stone Polishing,"Now, you’re able to create radioactive evolution stones that spontaneously evolve any Pokémon. Once per day, you may use your fossil reanimator for six hours to turn an ordinary stone into a Radioactive Evolutionary Stone.

You may only use your portable fossil reanimator once per day, regardless of the feature you are using."
