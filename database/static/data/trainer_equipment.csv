Trainer Accessory,-1,"Whenever you roll a Skill Check while talking to someone else, you may add +2 to your roll. If your skill check succeeds, the Trainer Accessory cannot be used this way again unless repaired with the Practical Designer feature. A person can only benefit from one trainer accessory at a time."
Lucky Charm,-1,"Whenever you roll a Skill Check and fail, you may reroll and use the second result. If you fail again, you fumble in some way and lose 1d10 hit points. The Lucky Charm cannot be used this way again unless repaired with the Lucky Charm feature. A person can only benefit from one lucky charm at a time."

Pokémon bound by Coiled Styler cannot move or use attacks unless they break free by besting you in an athletics Skill check, but they will roll the skill check twice using the lower result."
Scanner,-1,"Your specialized goggles help to assess situations when Pokémon are wreaking havoc. 5/day, as a free action, you may reveal target Pokémon’s current hit points as a percentage representing its amount of hit points out of its max hit points. In addition, the googles these scanners are attached to are able to see through fog, smoke, heavy sandstorm or any other moving non-permanent visual obstruction."
Shield Styler Attachment,-1,"Sometimes the threat of attack will make you want to have a shield and this attachment expands a shield made of energy to help protect you from enemies. When you or an adjacent ally is attacked, the foe must roll +1 during accuracy check in order to hit. If an opponent fails to hit after attacking you or an adjacent ally your energy shield shatters and must recharge for 1 min before it is reformed. You may not use the Shield Styler Attachment while using Wrap with the Coiled Styler Attachment."
Rebreather,-1,"For special underwater missions, the rebreather is a valuable tool when a Pokémon can’t help to take you underwater for extended periods of time.

After the rebreather is used for at least half an hour, it must be cleaned and dried, rendering it unable to be used for two hours."
